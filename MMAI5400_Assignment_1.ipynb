The guy in the tire department was sitting at a desk in an adjoining office looking at a computer and showed no inclination to move, so I went over to another guy in the parts area and asked him if he could help me. He said no, and directed me back to the guy at the computer. Waited another 10 minutes until he finally looked up and noticed me. He printed out an estimate for the tires I wanted and told me it would be at least a month before I could get them. He was a grumpy, curt, disinterested old guy who obviously has been there much too long and has lost the joy of serving people, or even pretending to be interested. I wanted my new tires installed within a day or two, not a month, so with this in mind and the bad attitude of staff in that department, I drove immediately to another tire dealer and purchased a full set of new tires installed the next day, and at a much better price than Canadian Tire.\",\n",

              " \"              I went to several Canadian Tire locations in Toronto to buy basic necessities\\xa0during this period of despair and social unrest, at a time of unprecedented\\xa0crisis. All the locations I went to refused to let me in. I am a person with a medical disability and I can not wear a mask because\\xa0it restricts my breathing. Even though I shopped at these locations regularly, during the pandemic, and always identified myself as a person with a medical condition, and a person of disability, this all came to an end as of March 2021. I was informed at these locations that they were enforcing a zero\\xa0admittance policy for individuals who can not wear a mask. They refused to provide names,they did not provide any accommodation, and stated they could remove anyone from their store for no reason at all, and they had a right to protect themselves from people like me. They did not provide any such policies, they refused to provide any explanation, and at two of the locations the managers would not even talk to me. I was told to leave or the police would be called. At the third\\xa0location I recorded the interaction, and it will shock you to hear what the manager had to say.The Canadian Tire locations were at\\xa0 1901 Eglinton ave , 1025 Lakeshore Ave East, and 2850 Kingston Rd. I filed a non-compliance complaint against every location. On March 9, 2021 I filed a\\xa0Human Rights Violation complaint with Canadian Tire. They didn't seem to care and basically told\\xa0me this was a store owner policy rollout and they encourage me to direct any further questions or\\xa0concerns about retail regulations to the government. In the video that I recorded, the Manager states\\xa0that this is a nationwide rollout by Canadian Tire and not the owners. The purpose is to remove the\\xa0basic rights of disadvantaged people or groups. Based on the way I was treated, this is merely an\\xa0attempt to use Economic Hardships to portray people who are disadvantaged as being subhuman or insignificant through various forms of violence, whether institutional, verbal, physical or mental abuse. This will escalate. When government leaders state that businesses have the right to refuse entry to people who do not wear masks and your Police Authority backs these statements by threatening\\xa0to remove such people from businesses for trespassing, this in itself shows the system is not inclusive. It portrays a cold calculated and methodical incitement of hatred, portrayed against identifiable groups, where bias and zero accountability is utilized as a social tool for the destruction of Equality, for the poor, weak,disabled,and many other identifiable groups. People will continue to be\\xa0marginalized through companies like Canadian Tire, as long as they propagate\\xa0bias through unregulated Policies that discriminate against disadvantaged people or groups. No one should be forced to submit to differential treatment in a public setting in order to use platforms that are available to the masses, including basic services, economic equality, and full participation. The system portrays itself as being safe and fair but without transparent regulation or full accountability, there are no safeguards\\xa0and companies\\xa0like\\xa0Canadian Tire will punish the poor and disadvantaged for simply existing. In my mind I believe that holding\\xa0Companies like Canadian Tire accountable is a step in the right direction. People shouldn't have to live in the shadows or in fear, because they are different. The Economic engine of public society should not\\xa0be used as a portal of inequality and social order should not be progressed through the deprivation of basic human rights. This is an organization that has portrayed its true colours. This isn't a mistake or an error, but instead something very sinister. When you project hatred towards certain groups and individuals,\\xa0the brutality of Persecution will follow. This time they did it to me. Next time it will be someone else.\",\n",

I bought a vacuum about 4 months ago and I needed a new filter for it. Stupidly thinking that I could get a filter for the machine that I bought there only to discover that they do not carry the filter. I talked to the manager of the Leduc store to see if I could order in the filter and was told no because the vacuum that I bought 4 months ago is being discontinued and that they only had 24 more in stock. The price for this vacuum is $249.00 so it is not a cheapie vacuum and now they won’t even order filters in for them. BUYER BEWARE. This is not the only thing that we have purchased there. Awhile back, we bought a weed eater and we needed an extra spool of wire because we used up the spool. Guess what - they don’t carry the spools there. Why do they sell these products if you can’t get simple replacement parts for them. I have definitely learned my lesson about buying anything there that needs parts to be replaced later.',\n",

Next day by chance I checked the light and bulb is still not working. I went to Canadian Tire and complained about that they said we will get it done quickly. I refused because they cheated and charged for the job mechanic never did. The floor manager said we can give you bulb and refund $56 for the labour. I said you have to refund shop charges also, because you are charging shop charges for the job,mechanic never did but floor manager refused to refund that. I asked her to let me talk to senior manager who refund shop charges also. This was really disappointing and breach of trust of customer.

I called them back and they told me to get it back to check for a second time. They told me that this time a valve needs replacement, I have to pay another 160, and I need to bring my vehicle back for a third time to do it. All in all to do the exact same work to another repair shop would have cost me 450$ to replace the spark plugs and the 2 coils. I ended up paying 1350 and still having my engine light on.

Not refunding the two missing items (ball &amp; chair)4. Double charging for cleats5. Not refunding for missing ball &amp; chair AGAIN6. TRIPLE charging for cleats7.

I said that I would still buy the tires and to put tires in the truck. INSTEAD, they put the tires on the rims, without alignment but balances the wheels. After that I spoke with the arrogant service manager (WP01), which lied and fabricated stories to his boss, and also blame on me that I should have known since it took lots of time. The guy is a lunabin, since how would I know what's going on in his garage while he is strong behind a piece of glass and garage is hidden so you can not see in it anyways. So, I spoke to Mike, his boss, and he took side of his arrogant service manager. Figures. I do not recommend this shop at all, run away. Oh ya, one last thing, I went to a different shop this morning, guess what they said, that ball joints and tie rod ends were just fine. No need to replace.

I looked around for about 5 minutes but didn\\'t see anything so I asked someone where I could find this item. He says, \"IF we have it, it\\'s in aisle 94 &amp; 95\". Go to the other end of the store, look around, nothing. Spent another few minutes looking for someone else to ask. They said, \"IF we have it, it\\'s in aisle 84 &amp; 85\". Go there, look around again, nothing. Find 2 men talking to each other with walkie talkies in their hands (management maybe?) and ask where I can find the item. One of them says, \"IF we have it, it\\'s in aisle 84 &amp; 85\". I say, \"no, I\\'ve looked there\". He says, \"then it\\'s in aisle 94 &amp; 95\". I say, \"no, I\\'ve looked there too\". \"Oh\", he says, \"then we don\\'t have it.\" I say, \"well, online, it says you have 5 at this location.\" \"Oh, let me check then. Do you have the item number?\" (Seriously?) So I go on my phone, turn on my data, do a google search and give him the item number. He gets on his walkie talkie repeats the item number to someone on the other end and tells me to wait by the cash and someone will bring it out to me. I wait at least 15 minutes before I decide that maybe I should go to Customer Service. So I wait in line for another 10 minutes before I can ask about my item. Girl looks on her computer and says, \"Oh, it hasn\\'t been picked up yet. I\\'ll call again. Can you wait to the side for me while I help another customer?\" Sure, I don\\'t want to be unreasonable but by this time I\\'m so mad I\\'m almost in tears. 10 minutes later (not exaggerating) someone comes with the box. I noticed that the box was torn but by this point I just wanted to get the hell out of there. Girl at the counter was very nice, thanked me for my patience. I get home, THERE ARE PIECES MISSING!!!!

Well first she pretended she couldn\\'t see the sale the other store was having on her system, then when she admitted it, she said the store manager refuses to do price matching with other stores when there is a \"clearance\", but I know that often the store brings in a dozen or two of an item when they have a store sale.  Then she gives me a speech about following \"policy\" and how the stores are individually owned and the owner sets the policy etc etc.Anyway, most Canadian Tire owners have everyone trained as if they are some high powered oligarch.  Well maybe they are, but I am, and have been in the past primarily so dissapointed with the attitude of these people and their employees, that I am at the point where I will not shop there.  Case in point, after leaving the store yesterday, I have purchased 3 cookers and 2 vaccum sealers from Amazon. That\\'s the first $1,400 Canadian tire will not get from me.  And I should say that the store I mention is in Brantford Ontario, and while a store like the one on Pine Bush in Cambridge Ontario have excellent people and amazing and friendly and consistant customer service, I will not be going back there either, because they all fly under the same banner.  Maybe the guys who run the good shops should get on the case of the poorly run operations.

I got a message back saying it didn't meet the guidelines and to make sure the review was shorter and didn't mention safety concerns and that anything regarding safety concerns should be dealt with through the company... so now what we have in this country is one company hiding how they're dealing with potential health risk and another company deciding that they will be the judge of whether or not anybody gets to call out the first company on their lack of communication.  So this isn't just a matter of Canadian Tire pronouncing themselves the authority on what is a safe toy and making sure one parent doesn't share concerns with others, as if that's not bad enough, they are also pronouncing themselves the authority on what people are allowed to say regarding the transparency of all their suppliers.

              " \"              Having worked in customer service my entire life, for various companies, nuclear, government, and retail I know a thing or two about customer service. I currently work in Minden and would often go to this particular store for all of our household necessities and any vehicle dealings. I have spent a number of years spending money at the establishment.I went in recently for an oil change on my vehicle, one that I do not drive often although never have any issues with. It is simply a commuter, so I only brought it in for an oil change this day.We maintain and have our vehicles in to the mechanic regularly for general maintenance and upkeep, so regardless that they are older vehicles, they are well taken care of.The car had no issues with it, specifically the ones I experienced beyond attending the Canadian Tire shop on this occasion.After the oil change, I went into my car and I could not turn the key over, I tried various things to get it to work, such as moving the wheel and nothing worked. I also noticed a mechanical issue started to happen wherein my doors would lock with me in it after a couple of minutes. We have not had these issues before bringing it to your shop. Something was locked, or messed with causing it to do this. Things happen, understanding with that, although I would have expected the same attitude in return as well. I was late getting back to work that day after my appointment. I was quite upset at the response and lack in support I received from the staff. The mechanic who worked on my vehicle had a beard and tattoos and he was very sarcastic, unprofessional and just simply rude to me from the get go. His first approach in speaking to me was degrading my level of experience driving a standard vehicle, I had to explain to him that I have been driving standard vehicles for 15+ years, so this was completely unnecessary. He would not get into the vehicle initially to try and help me out, he just put his hands up and used COVID as a reason which makes no sense as he was already in it previously.He laughed at me several times, indicating that my logic was invalid.Both the employee and the auto manager were very defensive from the start, did not offer me assistance in any way until I demanded some support.I simply could not at that point start my vehicle, I had no way to get to work and was forced to stand outside in the freezing cold with no options. I was left to figure it out for myself, which the manager and employee working in a customer service retail environment, especially under the circumstances should have been helpful, accommodating and sympathetic, they were the complete opposite. I was low on phone battery too which posed a bit of concern as I was unable to enter the establishment to contact someone for help.Left by both at this point in tears, as I don't live nearby, and my husband being at a job hours away, I ended up contacting the main store floor manager, and spoke to Janet.Janet was extremely helpful and kind, she immediately came out and spoke to me in person, offered to drive me to my place of work so I could get back to work and leave my vehicle in the meantime to take a look at. She was great, I was advised by her later that afternoon that another employee was able to get my car started and they said it was some form of locking system that had occurred on the vehicle and that it shouldn't happen again. I believed this to be true because this only happened that day, and never previously before.Upon getting back to my vehicle at the end of the day, the issue persisted.  After spending another half an hour trying to get it to start, I made it home, but the take home experience will never be forgotten, the auto staff and manager were completely disrespectful, unhelpful and rude. Upon addressing this with the store owner, Terry, he too said there was nothing they could have done to help me any further and also put his hands up. He did apologize but it sounded insincere, simply to just to brush this complaint and experience under the rug. My take home from all of this is that I strongly urge those in the area to not use Canadian Tire auto in Minden, as you could experience the same treatment as I had. This was not the first time I was treated poorly by the auto staff there when something I found was wrong with my vehicle after they had it, all they do is say it wasn't on them. While I agree vehicles break down and things happen, since that day the car has been fine and the issue has not happened, so clearly something happened during the oil change and quality customer support and service on that day should have been the result of what happened. My family will no longer use this store for business and certainly not auto work. I will also be sure to pass this along to friends and people I know in the area as I would hate for someone to have to go through this experience.\",\n",

The man on the phone was very nice and let me know there was no problem to do so. The service was done in around 2 hours. It’s a 5 minute  job but I understand that people are busy and that they were fitting me in as I didn’t make an appointment based on the phone call I had with the service provider over the phone prior to heading over. He told me there was 2 batteries that would work for my vehicle and I went for the $199 as it had an additional year warranty. When I went to pay the total was a little over $300. As I walked out to my car I thought that was a little high as the price of the battery was $199. What I am dissatisfied with, in regards to the service, is that at no point did he tell me there was any additional charge aside from the battery and charged me the price without even saying anything OR going through the bill with me afterwards. I should have been given all the information so I could have made a decision if I wanted to pay 84$ to have a battery put in. I would have politely said no thanks, bought the battery and put it in myself. It’s 4 bolts and I am more than capable of doing so. It’s so frustrating at a time where money is tight that the service department wouldn’t be transparent about pricing. As like I said, I would’ve opted out and done it myself AFTER purchasing the battery from you guys.Not happy at all as I felt blindsided and that wasn’t made aware which is completely unacceptable.',\n",

The products specifically paint, house brand is just horrible, it does not stick to the walls, it is perhaps the poorest quality paint I've ever used.  When I contacted head office about this they took weeks (6) to respond to my complaint.

We also can’t do the alinement until it’s fixed.”I paused for a second and asked      “How much will that cost?”He said      “An extra 1400 dollars, do you want us to start now?” I said     “No, I want you to show me what’s wrong first.”My dad and I went there and listened to what the guy had to say, he also said that he noticed right away something was wrong cause my truck was pulling to the left, I said I never noticed it pulling to the left, he said that I had probably just gotten used to it.then I paid 66$ for there “inspection” and took it home and took it apart.On my drive home I barely touched the steering wheel to see if it was pulling to the left, it wasn’t.All four front brakes have just over 6millimeters on them. (which is plenty) And the rear brakes have about 5. (also plenty) My calliper isn’t siezed and is working just fine.My dad and I go back there to talk to the mechanics again, they put it on the host, they tell us to spin both front wheels, we do, and the front left one is SLIGHTLY stiffer They then said that the reason its stiffer is because the calliper is starting to seize, as soon as that happens, the brake pads get burned and need to be replaced (which isn’t what they told me on the phone, I was told that there wasn’t anything left on my front left brake pads) They also said that my rear brake pads are lower then there supposed to be and that’s why they recommended replacing them,I asked why I was told that there wasn’t anything left on my front left brake and why I was told there was only one millimeter left on the rear brakes, and the mechanic got really defensive and said, “you must’ve misunderstood what we told you on the phone” (F*** I wish I hadve recorded that phone call cause that’s EXACTLY what I was told and you can go f*** yourselves) My dad asked, okay, even if all that’s true (which it wasn’t) why couldn’t you do the alinement? They said that since it’s pulling to the left, they don’t wanna do the alinement and have us come back in a few days later and say, “it’s still pulling to the left” (which I would agree with, IF my calliper was seized and it was pulling to the left) My dad said,      “it’s barely stiffer, I didn’t even notice a difference when we were at home and I don’t really notice one now, I don’t see how that stops you from doing an alinement” And I guess that pissed the mechanic off cause he went on a five minute rant about how he he’s a professional mechanic who knows what he’s doing and we aren’t 🙄1 thousand four hundred dollars...Either they saw I was a 20 year old boy with a nice truck and thought they could rip me off, or they’re just idi*tsAfter my second time talking to the mechanic, I took my front left brakes apart just to make sure the sliders were moving easily and the brake pads weren’t burned, everything looks brand new and moved easily (I also just replaced the front brakes and routers a year ago) I’m honestly pissed that Canadian tire tried to pull this on me and wouldn’t admit they were wrong, I definitely won’t be going back there',\n",

              " '              I learned a valuable lesson, and that is do not deal with the Canadian Tire auto department. They have terrible customer service. I’ve been put on hold by their front-line employees on most occasions for over ten minutes as they pick up the phone and place it back on hold multiple times until I give up and just hang up. Originally, I went in for new tires, which led to multiple other cross-selling techniques to have additional work done. A couple of the charges that were added were for things like license plate bulbs and a new battery, which the latter had been replaced months before by AMA. These are techniques that the front-line workers are taught in order to make more sales. I agreed to other additional work which was nightmarishly slow and fraught with mistakes. After finally getting my vehicle back and paying a high sum of money for the repairs, the parts failed 6 months later. When I came back, they wanted to charge me almost $700 to swap the warrantied parts out for new ones. I feel that every interaction with them is negative, and I don’t know if they’re lying. I am now dealing with a new mechanic who will replace the parts Canadian Tire put in and will have to pay for the new parts and labour that Canadian Tire refused to rightfully refund. Dealing with the manager Trevor H in particular was not pleasant as he is very rude and unreasonable. I was shocked that someone in customer service could get away with his behaviour. The only recourse with Canadian Tire is to continue to escalate your problems which only wastes more of the customer’s time.

CT gave an unsolicited estimate on replacement of the front brakes for my Accord (2 weeks ago), so I called around to compare prices and found their estimate was competitive, at 15% below the cost of the same repair elsewhere, so I went ahead with the repair. I waited 3 hours for what I was told would be a 90-120 minute job. (The employee told me they had ordered the wrong rotors that morning, once they’d taken my car into the garage for the repair...) In the end, the bill was more than $100 above the estimate. I was informed after comparing the previous printed estimate with the actual work done, that whoever created the estimate 2 weeks ago ONLY INCLUDED ONE, not TWO rotors to be replaced on my vehicle! Hence the difference in cost. This organization can’t get the correct number of, AND required type of parts to repair a car correctly, or provide an accurate estimate. No offer was made to waive the fee of the undocumented part in the estimate, or make up for their misleading oversight. The employee only replied with, “Well, it is just an estimate.” Does that mean a CT ‘estimate’ for new winter tires only includes the price of 3 new tires? Do they then tack on another 25% for the fourth tire, when they’ve completed the work?!!! Deceptive. Unprofessional. Unethical. I will never service a car there again. Go with individually owned garages; they have far more at stake to protect their reputation. CT clearly couldn’t care less when they lose a potential repeat customer.',\n",

The last few years I've had several burn out and I would just return them without a problem but today I took a couple back and was told that they changed the warranty and I now have to go after the manufacturer because they are no longer honoring the over the counter warranty beyond 12 months.

When I got home I decided to call Noma and Eric asked me what it said on box and do I have my original receipt. I told him it says 10 year limited warranty and the date on it was oct 2017, so he said they have to honor the warranty as all Noma warranty is through Canadian Tire. I was then given a case number and a phone number for them to call Eric and that he will walk them through it.

They pointed to a line which was only 20 people deep with over 4 cash registers in operation. I even offered to help carry the soil / simply just wanted someone to grab the soil from the back / warehouse - they continued to “chat” with each other and ignored me.I’ve never experienced a retailer ever in my life that turned me away citing the reason that “they are too busy” - the line was a joke, and an even bigger insult was the fact that I had to cut through everyone forcefully just to exit the store due to the way the exits forced people in the same line even if they were not purchasing anything - given social distancing best practices, one would think you would have a separate line for those who did not purchase anything to be able to exit your store and go about their day without having to be subjected through a deliberate and claustrophobic maze with the potential of getting infected with COVID-19 on the way out.It is clear that if your store is “too busy”, maybe you should consider hiring more staff. It would be a prudent choice given that your employees clearly aren’t worth the $14 / hr to begin with - so you better double up!Likewise, you may also wish to start hiring a security guard if this location has to resort to subjecting people through a defined / controlled path just to exit regardless if they are purchasing or not.Let me be clear - this has been an ONGOING problem  over the years - it is not just isolated to this one incident - I've only now decided to take time out to write this review in an attempt to bring light to the fact that this location is in clear need of review or purging.\",\n",

He was very angry and tried to kick me out of the store. I eventually got my son involved who is a Professional Machanical Engineer. My son had them send him some pictures of the damaged oil pan.

In other words the report concluded that the Canadian Tire technician was tightening the bolt and cracked the oil pan. Too much torque was applied to the bolt. This report was also sent to an engineer at Canadian Tire head office who agreed with the report.After this report was sent to the store the store went quiet for 2 days and finally replied on the 3rd day that the car is being repaired at no charge! Upon picking my car up one of the young kids at the counter asked for the 680.00 pyment. When I refused he realised that he was supposed to only charge for the oil change (31.00)Whe I got into my car the front mat was pushed out of place and the maintainance light was not reset.Overall a very bad experience. I had no car for 4 days and they still charged me the measly 31.00. Thank God I had someone who could backup my claim and reveal how they lied after damaging my vehicle.',\n",

              " '              STRANDED ON THANKSGIVING DURING COVID19I have been a Canadian Tire customer my entire life and I have used the Canadian Tire Gas Card for last ten years at least. I love the card and getting 10C off my gas. Yes 10 cents because I am a big spender every month and usually pay off my entire balance. Recently due to illness in my home and losing my job along with all my kids,  I got behind on a payment. Due on September 29th and overdue by 10 days. I sent them $4200 last statement. When I went to pay for my gas the card had been locked. I called Canadian Tire customer service and spent 40 minutes on the phone with my family in my car on the way to Thanksgiving. I had no money as I hadn\\'t gone to the bank yet and could not pay for my gas. My son ended up paying for it after considerable embarrassment with everyone in the car. I talked to three levels of \"service people\" and none could help me. You see the \"system \" wouldn\\'t let them until I really complained and then suddenly it could. ?? THIS IS NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE - TERRIBLE! All of the the people were cold and unfeeling - and this during Covid! Starting with Roger  (Roggi) (rude and condescending) and ending with Ann Jamieson. I think it\\'s fair to mention their names but CT will probably delete this. I would have expected much more. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH CANADIAN TIRE. I will change my purchasing habits regarding Canadian Tire. Visa points work for me. Being in media I will produce a YouTube video to explain my experience further. These large corporations want us to go to a cashless society, and they will use any excuse (Covid) to do so to make it easier for them. Cash is too much trouble but this will be a loss of our freedom. Don\\'t let them go cashless! Can you imagine if we get into trouble (during a world wide event) what these corporations would do? They will literally deny us buying the necessary items even if we get behind a little bit. Doesn\\'t feel like Canadian Tire is \"bringing it on\" to me.

I am certainly glad to experience this because I've discovered other retailers that are capable providing the goods and services I need at competitive prices.

I went in with my son at 8:50 p.m. to grab some spray paint for a project that I was working on, and then at 8:57, a sales associate named Dale, asked me if I was heading up to the front to pay as I was in the back of the store looking for some paint. I told her yes that we were heading up to the front, and while I was walking I was still looking at some merchandise as I still had time it was not 9:00 p.m. yet. This associate named Dale, continued to follow us and then said I am sorry but you need to leave now! I looked at my watch and the time was 8:57 and I said ma'am I still have 3 minutes and I am trying to find something there is no need to kick your customers out! she then became extremely aggressive and threw something down on the floor and said all right that's it you need to leave now get out! She literally started screaming at me and then paged for her manager to escort me and my son out of the store . I asked her why she was being so rude and difficult... and that instead of yelling and screaming at me she could try helping me to find the product that I was looking for. She embarrassed not only my son and me but herself and your whole entire organization! Her manager came and did not even try to de-escalate the situation and instead right away told me I needed to leave. I did not even get a chance or an opportunity to pay for the products that I wanted to purchase as they would not allow me to do that even though it was still not 9:00 p.m. they were still other customers in the store at this time shopping, and paying for their merchandise. In all my life I have never been treated so poorly by a customer service representative nor did I see any resolution offered by her manager to try and make the situation better. I believe the store manager's name was Amir.....I believe I deserve an apology I did not do anything wrong and yet I was made to feel awful embarrassed and I was treated like I was a criminal and was escorted out of the store only because I had told this cranky old lady Dale that I still had 3 minutes to shop which I did! I am also a customer experience manager for another large format store in Calgary and I tell you that if I ever saw any of my staff treating customers the way that Dale and Amir treated me, and my son they would definitely be repercussions, and I think that Dale needs to be spoken to about her behavior, and may need some retraining on customer service, talking to the public, and not being biased as I feel that I was singled out. I would like a follow up please, and I want an apology not only from the store manager but from this Dale associate, and I want to know what gives her the right to kick me out of a store, when I was simply asking a question! Extremely unprofessional! And I will be letting other people know about this experience!\",\n",

There is another gal who always stands at the podium at the self check out. Sullen. I have witnessed her making fun of shoppers behind their backs, rolling her eyes about them, whispering nasty comments. The customer service staff that I am referring to have been there for years. Older women.  I have already spoken to your Customer Service Manager, who said she knew who I was talking about, standing at the podium, at that time and would speak to them. Obviously that didn\\'t work. What is going on in this store ? Would love an explanation. Where is management ? Why is it always Canadian Tire that treats people like this ? I am a shopper, frequent many stores, no one ever treats me or anyone else like this.  Time to hire new staff that appreciate their job, have a great working environment, not toxic and miserable.

              " \"              I'm a Uber driver that needed an annual safety inspection. I usually get it done at the Ajax location, with no issues. That location no longer provides the discounted service because of new ownership.                  I  went to the Canadian Tire in Pickering on Brock Rd on September 29th for the first time.  I will be using baseball analogy for this review. The first person I dealt with told me that the inspection would take 2-3 hours. Not a deal breaker but I know it usually takes a bit over an hour (they weren't busy). Strike one. The mechanic that was servicing my 2 year old Civic (60,000 kms) called me over.  He told me that all 4 of my brake rotors needed to replaced because of rust. I'm not a mechanic but I found this to be strange because of the age of the car and the mileage. The brakes were operating perfectly so I  declined the service. The total cost would have been in excess of $700. Strike two! I then paid for the inspection with the automotive manager. The Uber discount price should have been $80 but I  noticed that I was being charged $105. When I  asked the manager why not $80. He said that the $80 price does not exist and it was Internet fake news like Trump tweets. Gave him the benefit of doubt and paid the bill. When I  got home I checked my previous invoice from the Ajax CT, the manager lied to me or is missed informed. I would have been ok with it if he had just told me that they weren't honouring the discount. Strike three, you're out.  I decided to pay a local mechanic $120 for a second opinion. My civic passed the inspection with flying colours, no issues. I can't help but feel that I  was ripped off by the Pickering location. Fortunately I didn't fall for the brake job scam!                                                          I will never give this location my business again!  Buyer beware!\",\n",

They said they'd call me if there were any problems. Monday afternoon, having heard nothing from them, I called to see if my car was ready.  They told me it needed tyres.

Tuesday came and went and, once again, I had to call them to see what was happening - still no tyres, might be in tomorrow.  By Wednesday afternoon, it seemed that I might be waiting forever for tyres,  so I collected the car and took it  into a local Tirecraft branch where they located the tyres at a local warehouse and supplied and fitted a set early the next day  (at a saving of $500 over the price Canadian Tire quoted me) That should have been the end of it - the service manager in Napanee said I'd just have to bring the car back so they could quickly inspect the new tyres and they'd issue the safety certificate.  How long does it take to inspect a set of new tyres?  How about over an hour ?  That should have been the last of my dealings with Canadian Tire Napanee.

Not only were women's hiking boots, shoes and clothing limited in the sense of UGLY DRAB colours but even the vests they had on sale were MEN'S and cute but not ONE ladies vest and NONE of ANY Ladies clothing was on sale. C'mon Canadian Tire. You are in 2020 the age where women HUNT, landscape, work in skilled trades, HIKE EXTREME, Walk dogs and do all sorts of house repair and house renovations SO why are you still limiting your CLOTHING and SALES to MEN only. I could actually make a thing of this, I mean how discriminatory is the store becoming where as a woman I felt absolutely excluded from being able to purchase anything of quality and good value!\",\n",
              " '              I went to Canadian Tire in Bowmanville, Ontario to have new tires put on.   When I came back,  I  wanted to make sure that the tires were new (as they looked used) and told the Manager.  His comment was\"...if you want I can have them shined to let you know they are new\"...what a f/p (pardon my French),  when you spend $700.00 for new tires,  you should be able to ask questions.  I did ask to see the old tires and dealt with another individual,  she was fantastic...showed me the old ones where threads were used and also showed me the new ones.   That\\'s the kind of service you need.,  she should be the Manager,  not that old goat who has attitude problem and should not be dealing with the public.   If he does not like his job,   get another one!   Canadian Tire have had a lot of negative comments lately...they should look into those issues more closely.    Everything is blamed on covid-19...but hey business  is still moving on,  and customers do expect good service.  I would appreciate it if someone could respond to my complaint.  I will know if Canadian Tire pays attention to how employees treat their customers.',\n",
              " '              On August 25, 2020 I took my car in for maintenance at the Cambridge Pinebush Canadian Tire location as I was losing air in my back left drivers tire. I sat for an hour and a half, when the representative yelled out \"bad news, the tire can\\'t be fixed.\" I went up to the counter and she proceeded to tell me the tire could not be patched, but failed to give me an explanation as to why or what was even wrong with the tire. She then proceeded to tell me she was looking up a quote for not one tire but two. Apparently I needed two new tires when only one tire was losing air. She then assumed that I was going to purchase new tires and told me the quote for two new tires would be $1000+ and that she could have then ready for pick up the next day. I was very taken aback as I was not given any information as to what was wrong with my tires. I was not asked what I wanted for options they were just forced on me. I feel that just because I am a female, they assumed I would take their word and make the purchase. She then told me, after I asked what was wrong, that the tire was losing air and that the inside of the tire was no good because the RIM was causing damage inside the tire. I told her I did not want to purchase new tires as I was not going to pay $1000 up front that if I did need new tires, I could get them for a better price. My father in law took a look at the tire, and he ended up finding that there was a nail in the tire which he removed and WAS ABLE to patch. I am so disappointed in the service I have received as I felt I was lied to and I was just used to try and get a sale. They did not even tell me there was a nail in the tire!!! The representative told me they had taken the tire off so they would have been able to see that I had a nail in the tire. Why they could not tell me that I do not know and that makes me very angry. My father in law also told me there was no damage to the inside of the tire either, that the tire is still in perfect condition so clearly Canadian Tire just wanted my money. I would have paid the money to get my tire patched as I had been waiting 1.5 hours and for what, nothing. I am lucky that I have someone that has knowledge as I did save myself some money but I am angry that my time was wasted. I would not recommend taking your vehicle here as they just try to rip you off and push any sale on you that they can. I feel that just because I am a female they felt that I would be easier to get a sale out of. NEVER GET SERVICE FROM HERE',\n",

              " \"              Langford Canadian Tire is the worst Canadian Tire I have been to in my entire life. I have been there a few times thinking each time that everyone has off days... they cant be that bad all the time.  Customer service is abysmally slow and disorganized. I was at the Hillside Canadian tire looking for a sale item. The Hillside store said Langford had one and I should phone to have it set aside as it was the last in stock. I phoned the seasonal department which took a great deal of time to do as I got returned to the main switchboard no less than 4 times before someone answered. I explained to the person there that I had been directed by Hillside to phone about this item. I asked if they could put it aside as I was at Hillside and would have to make a trip out. They were not willing. I asked if they could please make sure if it was really in stock before I made the journey. No... they weren't able to... but they assured me that it showed in stock on the computer. So I made the trip out to Langford and when I got there, I was unable to find said item. I asked seasonal about it and they replied that it was in a special storage area. They would have to dig it out. So we waited. After a while we were told that we could pay at the register and they would bring it out when they found it. So we did. After about another 45 minutes we were finally told they didn't actually have the item in stock... the manager of the department said... Oh yeah... the computer system had been showing it in inventory for a long time but they had tried finding it months ago and couldnt find it then either. (No one had bothered taking it out of the system) so now they were going to give us a rain check. We would have to return the item. I found out there was one in Sidney, but we dont live anywhere near there... so I asked since we paid already, could they get one from there brought out. They said they dont deal with other Canadian tires. We would have to get the item refunded, which was a fun process of going through the painfully slow customer service line, then trying to explain that we paid for the item but it wasnt in stock so had to return something we didnt even have yet. We got the rain check and waited. About three weeks later we get a call that it's in stock. Great. Only I cant get there until a couple of days later. So I phone and explain what had happened before and ask if they could just hold on to it for a couple of days until I was out that way. They said no. A bit frustrated... I decided I better make the trip out sooner rather than later. In my haste I forgot the rain check. When I got there I realized what I had done and explained it to the customer service desk. I was met with the least amount of concern. They asked if I had any proof I had a rain check... so I got someone back at our house to message a photo of it. I showed it to them and they tried to photo copy my phone. They weren't able to and decided there wasnt anything they could do for me. I asked to speak with the manager and explained as much as I could about what I had experienced... but they were very mechanical in their response. It was pretty clear that they didn't care at all.Unfortunately this was only one of several experiences. I have dealt with other canadian tires in other cities and usually they have been great. This one, however is not. I would say go to Hillside if you are able to. Avoid this store.\",\n",

So I'm supposed to go to the app store and download an app and then scan something .I don't know because I didn't get that far because .I'm so pissed I wouldn't be able to do what I want because its a delicate piece of jewellery and don't want to ruin it and I just wanted to know the what speed to put it on and which attachment to use along with how the polish works. But instead of putting that in a Manuel and placing it in the box so you can open the box read the Manuel and do what you want to do.This generation and how they don't have common sense blows me away,they make you go to a site were they have nothing about scan and learn only about sales and if you want a flyer emailed every week. I feel like smashing this thing .I'm livid and baffled on how they replaced the Manuel with some stupid mission I had to go on which was a dead end. I did it all went to the site were I figured they would have something saying scan hear and I would have my Manuel. Nope nothing.I swear the customers and there happiness with the product and how to use it means nothing nowadays.Then you try to phone a companies customer service department and your listening to recording after recording ,waiting and waiting .So I've wasted an hour or more going through all this crap and I'm worse off than when I started.No info on how to use it and I'm so upset I couldn't do what I wanted to because its meticulous and delicate and I don't want to ruin it.So I think I will stop doing business with canadian tire because that's what you do when you don't get treated good.

I have never been so humiliated or insulted in my life, and I won’t waste my money on this company ever again.My mum and I came into the store to buy some batteries. That was all. We were wandering around aimlessly trying to find them as the store was a mess, half of the stuff was not priced or correctly organized, shelves were picked dry and staff were nonexistent...well until my mum was wrongly accused of stealing and was followed around the store by the accuser. She tried to defend herself and say that she wasn’t doing anything but the woman became verbally abusive and accusatory for no reason. We got very uncomfortable by the shadow in blue and decided to buy the stuff we had come in for and leave as fast as possible. The woman that was following us, harassed us at the till and practically forced the item in question at us. When we denied the accusations the accuser became aggressive towards us and threatened us with a ban, when we said that we didn’t want to come back anyway. She pulled out her personal phone and took a picture of us. At that time my mum and I were feeling defensive and frazzled by the unfair treatment, I asked for video evidence and the woman denied it. So whipped out my phone and began recording what I could. The manager came up to me and yelled at me for having my phone out and told me to shut it off. I told her I had a right because we were being unfairly treated. And they said they were banning us and wanted us out of the store so I threw down what I was holding and walked out. My mum said “don’t you want us to buy this product?” And the manager said “I don’t care just get out.” My mum is physically disabled and needs a walker to Help her walk or she will fall etc, she feels that she was purposefully targeted by the “security guard”. She had found the package already open on the shelf and was trying to be a decent human and put it back together. In the process the item had dropped out of my mums hands because she doesn’t have the best motor function. The woman came around the corner and yelled at her for trying to break into the package with her keys, that were attached to her walker. She said she witnessed my mum puncturing the plastic with her keys and would not drop the accusation no matter what my mum said. It was a small game of Mexican train. And we got banned because we stood up to this woman with a god complex and a power trip. People like that should never work in the service industry.I’m hindsight I should have called the cops. But I didn’t. I called head office and they said they would get in contact with the owner and that he; Micheal; would get back to me on the issue.

The staff will only give an exchange on defective products, but if they have no product in stock, they refuse to obtain stock from another CT store. I phoned a store in the next town, to put the replacement bike on hold so I could go there and exchange it, they refused.  I was told to buy it online, but you can't buy it online, only in-store! I asked if I could buy it in-store to secure it until I could bring them the broken one from the city, they said I could but then I would not be able to exchange it for the broken one because the item can't be resold or exchanged once returned. Insane. I had to lug this exercise bike across 3 cities, on and off my truck, trying to get a replacement or a refund. To recap: They refused to get replacement stock even though the warranty is full replacement, I secure a replacement (last one available in the entire GTA), but they won't swap it for the broken one. You can only get a store credit that you can't use on a bike, because they have no more bikes.

              " \"              PLEASE DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE FOR REPAIR UNDER ANY CONDITIONI took my car here on June 25th for a simple cam sensor replacement. Over the next 3 days, the manage Joe called me and  a simple cost of $300 slowly went up to $1300.But that wasn't the issue. The problem was that they made some repairs without my permission which ended up damaging my engine. Well, you'd hope they'd take responsibility but they refused to replace or pay for the cost of the engine and referred me to their corporate office. Since canadian tire is a franchise, the corporate told me that they agree with the fact that the repair shop damaged the engine but they can't do anything about it. They told me to go sue the owner if I want the car fixed or just tow the car home. I urge you all to please please take the car to a local private repair shop. This place is a rip off. Another practice that they have is looking up your last name and previous visits to see if you have accepted their tactics to get fuel replaced or other schemes like that, and if you have... well they make sure you get something unnecessary done. For one whole month not only did I not have my car but they refused to provide a rental car. Again and Again I CAN NOT emhpsize this enough, please please don't visit this shop.

Today I asked for an oil change with synthetic oil but after the service I checked and found that the oil was not changed. According to the Supervisor,  it need two hours drive for oil to circulate and color to get clear. When I insisted the supervisor allowed me to bring the car inside for the technician to check again. After so much of discussion the technicians said,  he is sorry that he used regular oil instead of synthetic oil. I was pretty sure that they didn\\'t changed even with regular oil because the oil color was dark. The supervisor said that the  color can be dark if we use regular oil. I wiped the regular,  synthetic and old oil with my surgical mask to see the color difference but color of regular and synthetic oil were clear and the one in the engine was dark. At the end the manager agreed to reimburse the 20% of the payment and said human error can happen with anyone.  When I showed them the oil color difference and said the oil was not changed at first, he was getting angry and said \"you are saying I am a liar,  good bye and go\".

After bringing product home, I turned it on as per the manufacturer’s instruction manual. Product would run but would overheat in approximately 5 minutes. Will not turn back on until it cooled off (approximately after 15 minutes later with 2 shop fans blowing on the compressor). I returned the product to the store at 17:30 the same day! Canadian Tire would not give me a refund on the product since it was ‘used’. Really. How is one able to discover if a product is defective without turning it on? They were adamant that there would be no refund forthcoming as per Canadian Tire Customer Service policy. They would only exchange the product. After reading other reviews of this product I am very concerned regarding the quality and longevity of this product. I am also concerned that Canadian Tire doesn’t have the confidence in this product to offer a money back guarantee for it. Just think about that. Canadian Tire will not stand behind the products they sell and offer a money back guarantee. What does that say about their product lines or the retailer themselves? Why is Canadian Tire so out of sync with the majority of other retailers? Why is Canadian Tire not concerned with the customer experience and customer satisfaction? Is this a way to build brand loyalty? After a heated exchange with Jessica (The store manager for the day) I discovered that Canadian Tire does not empower their managers to make decisions that would best serve their customers. Instead, I was fed of a circular argument of not being able to return ‘used’ products back to the store for a refund, as per store policy. Only exchanges are acceptable to Canadian Tire. Store policies are arbitrary in nature and in the case of Canadian Tire their store policy does nothing to foster and build a positive customer experience. It’s pretty simple. If a product is defective (and in this case only hours old) one should receive full money back refund as opposed to an exchange. Full stop. (FYI, they do not provide a store credit as an option). If anyone is contemplating purchasing anything from Canadian Tire, I would suggest that prior to going to the cash register, open the product and test it out in store before paying for it. Otherwise you could be stuck in an product exchange fiasco. Better yet, find an alternate store to shop at.',\n",

Do you know how many bikes we are selling. We don\\'t have the items.\" He then walked away without solving my problem at all. I had to complain to a second employee who offered an alternative pump, bell and helmet. I don\\'t understand why they would tell me to pick up an order that is not ready.

Firstly, this is the second time that I have ordered online, a product that was \"in-store\" for curbside pick up, and NOT received the notification email that my order was ready.  In both cases, I called to inquire, and the item was there and ready for pickup.  Today I arrived in the parking lot in the designated pick up spots and called the store (3:41 pm).  I ended up calling 6 times!!!  Five times the phone just rang and rang until it cut off and hung up.  On the other call, I actually got to press in the extension number, only to have it ring again until it hung up.  I am autoimmune comprimised, so curbside pick up is great for me at this time.  So I had to go into the store, line up at the customer service desk, as there was noone at the little \"online orders\" desk.  I had not taken my wallet into the store with me, since I was just picking up and the item was prepaid, but I came to discover that in order to pick up my item -- yes 1 item -- I needed to show ID EVEN THOUGH I presented a copy of the email showing my purchase.  The young man serving me was very kind and gracious and apologetic, but that does not excuse the poor service I received up to the point where this one employee finally assisted me.  I was almost 45 minutes to go into this store and pick up a pre-ordered light fixture.  This is NOT acceptable!  Please ensure that the system gets fixed and this does not happen so anyone else.

The good thing is, these old brick and mortar companies that don\\'t know how to sell online will be eliminated.

Next Please...\" So now we are up to Bait and Switch advertising, arrogant and downright rude customer service, and infuriating lack of any coherent corporate inventory strategy.

I ordered the item featured most prominently on the front page of their flyer.  I chose to have it sent to my local store which strangely had zero in stock.  After a week and half I spent 2 days trying to get through by phone only to have \"It\\'s in progress\" repeated over and over.  That is exactly what I could see looking online myself.  I wanted to know if it had left the warehouse or not.  They kept repeating it is in progress.  I asked to be put through to someone for a complaint.  I actually had to get pretty demanding about as the agent kept trying to brush me off.  Finally, after a very long wait, I was put through to a very pleasant person who told me that it left the warehouse yesterday and wouldn\\'t likely arrive for another week and half.  3 weeks to send a featured product?  I declined and ordered a better item from Amazon for less money.  Amazon\\'s guaranteed delivery date was still sooner than CT\\'s predicted date even with the week and half head start.  Pathetic.',\n",

This is why I placed an online order for curb side pickup at my local CT store (wonderland rd s, London Ontario).  First, the ordeal of placing the online order was frustrating.  The website is so outdated and slow, nothing is intuitive. Trying to pay was met with uncertainty because the payment confirmation page didn’t pop up until the 4th attempt.  I placed the order Saturday at noon and was hoping to have the items before the end of the day because the website indicated that orders would be ready within 4 hours.  Saturday came and went. Sunday came, so I decided to call for an inquire about my order.  It only took me about 2 minutes to navigate the phone system to get someone from customer service to take my call.  I explained that I order online yesterday for curb side pickup and was wondering if she could check on the progress of my order since the website indicated that orders are ready within 4 hours.  The rude lady on the other end just yelled out “we have over 500 orders to fill, so just wait for your confirmation email” and hangs up.  Now it’s Tuesday, so I decided to call again and was once again giving the virtual middle finger over the phone.  “Wait time is 6 days, so you will get any email in 3 or 4 days”!  1 week to process an online order for pickup?  What planet or century do we live in?  First and last time I’m buying anything from CT online for pickup or delivery.  I might avoid CT outright because of the staffs rudeness.',\n",

The box was carelessly taped over, and I asked to open it for a quick inspection. Not only was the corner protector broken again, the whole unit was dirty, with rust accumulation on the protector pieces. Apparently, someone used it well, broke, returned, and it was packaged and put back for sale! I asked about the other box in stock and was told that it had the same look, open and taped.

Infuriating if you had to wait 45 minutes to get in only to realize this. They are constantly changing the layout which is to be expected for a retail outlet but....1) You can never find the item you need so you have to search online so I suggest you install more of these around the stores.2) The prices are always incorrect or missing for products which then leads you to ask a staff member except you can't find one. I've had an issue with pricing every visit so I always allow time for this.I ordered a bike that was in stock last year (outside COVID) and there were so many issues with collection, the bike being built, and the quality of the bike after being built.

When I arrived home and started installation I noticed another wooden piece cracked and also missing 6 swing hangers. I have been trying to contact the store the whole week with no answer! Then I contacted KidKraft (the manufacturer) in the US and they were shocked how Canadian tires sold me an open box with broken pieces, they said I should not accept this product and to call the store again. This long distance call costed me more that 30$! I contacted Canadian tire customer service and they said they will try to call the store in behalf of me to solve the problem and to offer me a compensation and to send the parts, and that they will call me back. I have been waiting 3 days with no repy. Surprisingly, I was able to contact the store this morning and the lady told me that a manager will call me back shortly today. I waited the whole morning and afternoon with no phone call! I called them back and they were very rude saying that the managers are very busy and that they cannot find my case number, I should wait for customer service to call me back, they cannot deal with it! I asked her for the missing parts as I have been waiting too long and we need it for the kids, especially now with the pandemic time! They said they don’t have any parts (although last week on the pick up time when we noticed broken parts they replaced them in 5 minutes!). She said no manager is available, they are busy! And if I want I can return the product (although she knows already that half of the playset already installed and I live an hour away).Very rude and bad service.

When I first went in for Toyota Camry, he said, car needs, sway bars front, tie rod both, bearing both right side. 1- Did not give me any estimate or offered to fix (customer discrimination, under estimated customer potential).2- Give me estimate for tires with wheel balancing, tire \"insurance\", wheel alignment was suggested (I said yes), disposable fee, labor &amp; taxes.3- I got everything fixed the next day (May 5th 2020) at another garage, called for an appointment, no one picked phone (realize that), left message (no response, even the next day).4- Came on May 6th 2020. The guy behind the counter visibly surprised, that I got the expensive fix in a day (customer discrimination again, under valuing customer). 5- I asked him to install tires with the same estimate given to me before, I said you it in the System, the same (my assumption).6- I left car with them, came back, no alignment was done &amp; tire \"insurance\" was missing. 7- I had engaged one person to pickup &amp; drop CAMRY for me, I had to come back for alignment next day, engage the person again for drop off &amp; pickup again, both times discomfited from his sleep. 8- Now my tires are without insurance. 9- The person I delt with, was highly prejudice &amp; discriminatory, definitely lacked professionalism &amp; caused company loss in extra repairs &amp; left the disgrace for Canadian Tires. 10- His discrimination was racial &amp; religious as well. 11- He should be removed from any type customer service, if he judges his customers with his preconceived mental image.12- This person &amp; his attitude will stay with me for the rest of my life, very disturbing, perhaps equals PTSD.13- If Canadian Tires have to keep its reputation, they must lay off such employees. 14- I request the Stephen Wetmore President &amp; CEO and Susan O\\'Brien SVP Marketing, to investigate &amp; compensate me for the inconvenience.

This has tainted my opinion of Canadian Tire and after I finally get this thing returned, I will no longer be a customer.\",\n",
              " \"              I have been a customer of Canadian Tire Saskatoon for many years and for the most part satisfied with sale prices and purchases I have made. I recently ordered a barbeque on line with credit card information. I was told it generally takes couple days. After one week I hadn't received any confirmation or pick up instructions.  I phoned Canadian Tire and after waiting for some time my call got answered. I gave my name and lady said my order was cancelled. I told her I didn't understand that as there was several in stock when I ordered. I further advised you charged my visa over 500.00 right away before I even got confirmation and picked up barbeque. I asked why was it cancelled. Her reply was she didn't know anything about that. Unfortunate no one can answer phone with any knowledge of on line ordering. She appeared in a hurry to get me off the line. She stated my visa would be reimbursed in a couple days. We shall see. I will take this money and go to Lowes to purchase this item.  Very disappointed extremely poor service wish I would have read reviews first.\",\n",
              " \"              I see I'm not the only one having issues with the horrible customer service and the total lack of respect for protecting their customer's health and well-being. I ordered a product online, when I went to pick it up, they forced me to go inside the store to get someone to open the garage door to get  my purchase. When I get the product I already purchased, I noticed it was full of holes and in very poor condition, what I would consider a defective a defective product. I politely asked them to replace the item with a non defective product. I saw online that they have 11 in stock, but the person (sales rep.) became irate with me and refused to replace the product, I loaded it into my truck and I drove around to the front door of the store. I spoke to the person at the door explaining my issue and asking to speak to a manager, I was bluntly told that I had to enter the store or my complaint would not be taken seriously or processed at all. While I was waiting, I did my best to keep my distance from other customers and sales clerks, but it wasn't easy. Suddenly this manager walks to me and comes within less than a foot from me, I asked him to respect the 2 meter law put into place by the federal government to help people avoid the virus infection. He responded by laughing at me and started putting his fingers on my phone, laughing away. I turned around and left, I can't believe the way I was treated, absolutely no respect. I was forced to leave the store with the defective product I had already paid for because it was already loaded into my truck and I did not feel comfortable continuing under those circumstances. These people put my life at risk and they thought the whole thing was ilarious, no respect and they did not follow any of the guidelines they posted on their website, there was no curbside pickup, no signs with instructions, and nobody outside to direct customers.I wouldn't be surprised if this company gets sued for not respecting the current federal law in effect, obligating people, by law, to respect a distance of 2 meters. If you care about your health and your loved ones, like older members of your family, do not shop at Canadian Tire. That company obviously only cares about money and they could care less about their customers. This is an extremely dangerous place to shop and honestly they don't do curbside pickup, regardless of what their website says.Stay safe and avoid Canadian Tire and other businesses with similar environments that are likely causing the deaths of many of it's customers and family members.\",\n",

No confirmation email for another day. No \"Ready for Pick Up\" email for another day. So, I order two small items, and it took a week. Next, I arrive at the store, where you call the posted phone number, which tells me \"all circuits are busy\". After trying to call the number (I later found out it\\'s the main store number, and not a separate pick-up number.) for 15 minutes with no luck, I tried to get someone\\'s attention, and I was ignored. So, I walked to the front door to ask what I should do, and 3 Canadian Tire Employees started YELLING at me. One came right up to me (within two feet) and when I asked him to keep his distance he advanced further, almost pushing me back away from the door. He was rude, aggressive, and certainly appeared that he would have gotten physical, had I pursued it further. So, I went back to my car, and kept dialing. It took another 25 minutes to get through to the posted phone number. FINALLY!! Nope, not over yet....another 20 minutes, before my order was brought out to my car. With all of the good things that people and corporations are doing for the community during Covid-19 restrictions you would think that a company like Canadian Tire would be better at trying to offer curb-side pick-up rather than risking a huge loss of business through inconsiderate, aggressive behavior.

I wrote an e-mail to the manager and he said he would speak to her. It was a super busy Saturday and she was the only manager on the shift. They should honor sticker pricing as it is a merchandising issue not the customers, if you have it priced same price in 3 areas it should be honored, this manager needs to be fired as she has zero customer service skills and was rude and threatening to call the police.

She didn'teven request me to give her a good review.However, there are a few who just went to the warehouse to get a product and sell me hard to give her a good review.  They are Roshika and Maria which I found their actions very strange.Isn't it their job to get customer the product from warehouse.Then, there is Velvet who got me 2 heavy Airfryers from warehouse, she is very polite and helpful and did not make any request.  She is nice.Funny company.  Everyone seems to have a card with their names on wanting you to praise their service.\",\n",

Unfortunately for me, I misplaced the receipt for winter tire installation as I need it for my insurance.I was told that I would have to go back to the store to get the receipt as it's separate transaction from my purchase of tires &amp; rims. However, when I asked if I could get a receipt for my tires &amp; rims, I was told that they aren't able to?!!! CAN TIRE GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER.Add on: I just got an automated call asking me to take part in a survey to review their Customer Service.

              " '              I can’t believe I am typing a 5 star however the stars must have aligned for me today as a bad experience became a great experience. I purchased a hall tree, basically a seat with hooks to hang up jackets. It was 99 percent put together and only 4 hooks when there should have been 5. I was miffed, I called Canadian Tire tonight at 6 pm, pressed 5, got what I assumed to be some young kid who didn’t know much about anything but I was wrong. I spoke to Colin who listened to my issue about the hook, told me to come down to customer service, said to ask for David or Colin. I walked in the door and I saw Colin wheeling the hall tree behind the desk, he and the manager, David, got me my hook. Ok, likely someone might be short a hook if they buy that box but I WAS happy. I appreciate the effort from both these employees. Thank you',\n",
              " '              I am a young millennial and have just started to make a little bit of disposable income. I was excited to be able to buy my mom a vacuum for Christmas she picked out (since hers broke). My mom is a little petite lady, she needed a long vacuum to get those hard to reach places. She picked out a Shark, but it turned out not to be long enough for her. She packed it back up and gave it back to me to return because it did not meet her needs. Upon trying to return the product they would not accept it because apparently if it’s EVEN opened or plugged in they will not return it (according to the sales associate). The sales associate also said there was dust - which okay means my mom must have also tired it out. But what does that matter if its not suitable? You can try on shoes when you buy them at the store. Vacuums are in a box sealed up and you don’t know which one suits your needs or your floors. Just because it’s printed on a box doesn’t mean it is accurate. I will never shop at Canadian Tire again in my life I can confidently say that. Walmart, Lowe’s, the Bay, Home Depot, Costco ALL have better return policies and customer appreciation. I get it, they don’t want to loose their money so they deny you a refund. Vacuums are expenses, they aren’t a every day buy item, if the policy on them is so restrictive then inform the customer at the point of purchase that once the package is opened you cannot get a refund.  Part of being a multibillion dollar corporation is the corporate responsibility to educate and inform potential customers and patrons of store’s policies so they themselves can make an informed decision, if they would like to spend their hard earned dollars at your store. I can tell you that if I knew that the store return policy was so strict I would of 100% bought the item elsewhere even if it was at a higher price. Because what matters to me more than the product itself is the way a store/ retailer values their customer. Canadian Tire 100% showed me how much they valued me today. They showed that they valued the $225 I spent on the vacuum more than if I was satisfied or if the product met my needs. They placed more importance on keeping that $225 then keeping a customer. Having $225 was more important to them then having a life long customer. I can assure you no one from my family will EVER be shopping at Canadian Tire ever again.',\n",

In Thunder Bay the customer service says NONE left. I asked for a rain check, they gave me a rain check but I’ve been calling since or checking online. Customer service are a bunch of liars. It says  0 in stock or discontinued. Why bother giving rain checks if you can’t honour them. It used to be my favourite store, but not NO more. I will be shopping elsewhere and be treated like a REAL CUSTOMER! What kind of business are you running, false marketing, liars, nobody in store to help but customer service. I’m very frustrated.

The flat one was torn on the side, likely from a pothole.  She conferred with me and took the car to an  actual tire place.  They inspected all tires and replaced the one.

When I notified them that the brakes: pads, calipers and rotors, were replaced just 11 months ago -less than 7,000km, the person at the counter stated that the rear brakes are metal to metal.

No noticeable damage to the exhaust pipe connection.I took dozen of pictures and approached the manger and the shop mangers, confronted them with the pictures.

Six hours after I paid $977 my rear caliper (an area the mechanics touched) sheared off my car as I was doing 80km/hr causing my rear wheel to lock up and almost cause an accident.  Before this work my car had been at the same location to have a brake inspection done.  I paid 49.99.  They told me all was good.  Then on this visit Joe the service manager told me the rear driver's side caliper had incorrect bolts.  I asked why this wasnt noticed during the inspection.  I was told they only check pads and rotors.  On a brake inspection!?  This was incorrect as told to me by the store manager nathan.  I have been using this store since 1989 and NEVER had an issue until now.  So, after paying $977 and 6 hours later my caliper sheared off, Joe tells me it will be ANOTHER $1000.  This never would have happened had the brake Inspection caught the issue.  My car is still at the store and Joe is being very aggressive, condescending, and quite honestly, arrogant.   All I want is my car fixed.  Please help me.\",\n",
              " '              Today about 100 pm, I was in the Sarnia store at the Automotive Department inquiring about Rims for the winter tires that I already have. Now I know that because of the recent weather, this particular department would be busy and I was right. There was 2 employees in that department (young woman and a young man) and both were helping a customer and there were 4 of us waiting.The phone was constantly ringing as well. While waiting I noticed that the young man would stop his service with the person in front of him to answer the phone, I find this extremely rude. I have been in the customer industry for over 30 years and to me great customer service starts with a genuine interest in helping those that you are speaking to. I also understand that times have changed and alot of people do business over the phone or computer, but when you have a customer in your presence, that customer should be your number one priority. Skip to my turn, I told him what I needed and he began the search, - phone rings and he picks it up, comes back and asks a couple more questions and you guess it, phone rings again and again my turn is interrupted. I like Canadian Tire and am not going to say that I will never shop your store again, I think that some customer service training would be beneficial. I hope this inspires some training on your behalf.Thanks,',\n",

They had me waiting in the store for over 3 hours after I was told my car was ready to be picked up because I refused to pay my bill until they provided me with my used parts multiple times. I suspect this store knowingly committed fraud since upon assessment of the parts that were returned to me the measurements on the parts didn’t match with measurements on my bill. Which means they lied on my bill about my parts measurements in order to justify them needing replacement or the parts they did return to me are not mine (FRAUD). Ultimately in order to have my car released to me I had to pay a $680 bill. Upon making further complains to the service manager and assistant service manager I was offered a 20$ refund, which I declined.

This bike has not been riden for more that 6 hours and the chain broke resulting in my son falling and hurting himself.  I went to the Port Coquitlam location to have the bike repaired today but was told they need to order the part in and will will have to wait a week or so, I told them this is unexceptionable and that i would like a new bike as we needed it for this weekends camping trip.  The manager, Kyle came over to speak with me, as he walked up you could tell he wasn't happy about having to speak with me.  They way he spoke to me was absolutely disgusting, he told me if i didn't change the way i was speaking he would ask me to leave and bring my broken bike out.  He not only embarrassed me in front of other customers but wouldn't listen to what I had to say.  I understand that there are company policy's you need to abide by but this bike has less than 6 hours on it, this makes me question the quality that is being sold along with the person behind the scenes who is assembling them.  I am very upset at how i was treated today and don't have any plans on returning to that location.  At the end of it all they are getting a part from another location and they bike will be fixed.  If this is how a 'manager' treats customers i can only imagine how he is treating staff.Very disappointed in Canadian Tire today\",\n",

Not only did they charge me for an inspection that they weren’t allowed to do in the first place (since they claim they need the original registration to even do it) but, because my original registration will take over 30 days to arrive in BC, they said that they will have to charge me AGAIN for a full inspection.

While we were selecting life jackets, the rep advised that they could only find one kayak-- but were expecting another shipment in a day or two.  We paid for two kayaks, intending to pick both up when the second one arrived.   Meanwhile, we shopped for and purchased kayak racks for our car.   Three days later, they advised that the kayak was on indefinite back order.  However, there was one kayak at Canadian Tire in Kelowna, but the Penticton outlet was not connected to the Kelowna store and they could not get that one for us.  They said we should place our own order with the Kelowna store.  When we did so, they advised that it would cost $160 to deliver that second kayak to Penticton!   When we called head office to protest, the best they would do was a $50 gift certificate.$160 would null the sale price.  My husband took his work truck to Kelowna to pick it up.   We are very disappointed with Canadian Tire.  Long time customers deserve better treatment than that.  And a huge corporation like Canadian Tire can certainly afford to treat 40 year customers with respect.    The gift certificate might sit around for a long long time!1.

              " \"              I have received the worst service and customer service at their auto department that I have never seen in my whole entire life. I was constantly told lies  by the mechanics and the front desk personnel since I stepped into the store to get my car fixed. In addition, I was sold unnecessary parts and overcharged for service as well. My mistake is that I did not believe all those reviews posted online that the auto department in Bolton, Ontario are overcharging customers, selling unnecessary parts and services to their customers. Some reviews went further to accuse them of scamming customers. Now, I am a new victim of the auto service and I realized I should have believed those reviews because they were based on true stories.            Three days ago I took my car for repair because it wouldn't start. I was told that the mechanic had gone out of the store would be back in an hour or two. I decided to wait for him. However, after twenty minutes the same person who told me that the mechanic is away, came back to tell me that the problem was that the battery needed replacement. Although I had no issues with my battery, I agreed because I was in a rush. the part was $157 and labour was another $150. Then, he came to me and said that the problem wasn't the battery and we still had to wait for the mechanic. The question was who decided then that the battery was the problem? After an hour the mechanic showed up and did some test and told me that it was a soft ware problem, and they had to reprogram the car computer. I asked how much would that cost. The answer was about $175. In the following morning, I stopped by the store to inquire. I was surprisingly  told  that  they decided not to reprogram my computer but to replace it. I was shocked and asked why. They told me that reprogramming was not an option. I argued that the mechanic had told me the opposite. I asked them whether they called the dealer and the answer was no. Then, why the mechanic told me that my computer would be reprogrammed? Who decided to change plans? Why did not they call the dealer?  Then, in a few minutes, they came up with another story that they just called the dealer whom confirmed that the computer could not be reprogrammed and should be replaced. I had no choice but to agree because I needed my car as soon as possible if though I was certain that they weren't telling me the truth. I asked specifically, how much would my bill would go up to, putting in mind that my bill was at $619 at that time. They told me that my bill would go up to $1600. I asked for a break down of the expenses. They answered $ 560 for the computer and around $175 for the new keys and the rest for labor and transportation. Again, I had no choice but to agree, especially that they told me that my car might be ready in the afternoon of the same day or the following morning at the most. I called around 5 pm to see if the car was ready. The attendant told me the car was still at the shop and he had no idea. After I argued with him, he put me on hold 10 minutes and came back to tell me that he was sorry and the car would be sent to the dealer the following morning. I called today around 10 am and they told me that car was sent to the dealer and I can pick it up in the afternoon. So, I called at 5.15 pm, the person who answered the phone told me that my car was ready but I could not pick it up because every one left and there was no one to do my bill. That meant that my car arrived no one in the store cared to call me or even to do the bill? Anyways, I just asked out of curiosity if he could see on the store computer to how much was bill. I was Shooooocked and extremely  mad when he told me that my bill is $2309. I could wait and I walked 4 KM to the store  to see why I am being charged another $700 without asking for my approval. Why did not they tell me the truth at the beginning that my bill would be that high. They kept draining my money little by little by telling false stories, and or hiding the truth. I asked to speak to the General manager but I was told that he is on vacation; I asked about the store owner, he is on vacation; asked about a service manager but I was told they all gone. Then, my question who is managing the store at that moment. Finally, they got me a supervisor whom was nice and decent but with no authorities or power to make any decision or to resolve a problem. Now , my car is hostage at the auto department. Either I  submit to their tricky ways and pay the unjustifiable bill of $2309 or I can't take my car. When I asked yesterday about the old battery because I am sure it was fine, they said that they threw it away. However, when, i went today they showed me one of some old batteries lying by the front desk and said that was mine and it was bad. Also, when I asked about the old computer because I need to see if it was really defected, they said they got rid of it.           I am sure when I go tomorrow to speak  with one of thee managers whom deserted the store today, they will tell me that they miraculously found it and of course it will  be defected like the battery. Also, may be they will come up with ridiculous hidden fees to another few hundred dollars to my bill.  All lies after lies after lies.\",\n",

In fact, there was a flaw for sure because the 36mm didn't fit ANY of the 36mm lug nuts I tried. So, I waited 30 minutes to speak with an agent to make sure I could return it. She told me it would be better to return the item to a Canadian Tire store directly. I had 90 days to do it but returning it the same day would improve my chances to get a refund because used tools might be not refundable. It would have to be inspected first by the cashier at the service front desk. Well, ok… It was a two hour drive for me to get there during rush hour (the wrench was worth only $30...). There was a teenager who was the boss of it all and he explained to me that the wrench had to be in its original condition. Fine. My wrench was 100% brand new and still had the stickers and label attached. The teen had a different opinion and refused the refund. I asked to speak to a manager but there was a situation in the store and the manager wouldn't be available now. I was told to come back later tonight or tomorrow. There was no way for me to talk to somebody else. I didn't want to go home and called an agent, whom spoke to the teen (using my phone). Teen still refused to refund me. Ok.I went to another store (an extra hour of driving…) and after a 30 minute talk with a manager, finally got a refund. I heard the noise when he just dropped the wrench somewhere in the backstore with no special care at all. Yes. Fine. I'm still giving 3 stars because the brand new wrench was refunded after all.

I told her that the tire was not taken off the car, no work was done. So she went to the mechanic and asked if the tire was removed from the car and he told her it was not. He told her all he did was he looked at the tire and determined it was not repairable. Even after this conversation she said she would not remove the charge. At this point another store manager had joined the argument (name was Eric). I asked him if he knew what the issue was and he said no. So I explained it to him. I told him do you train your employees to advise the customer of all charges before they hand over their keys. He said I would assume she had advised you of the charge. I said that is a great assumption, the rep was standing right there, so can you please ask her if she had told me about the charge? He asked her and she told him no she didn’t, and she only told me about it after the fact. And even then he said he wouldn’t do anything because the work had already been done. After which I explained to him that the other store manager has already asked the mechanic and there was no work done.They refused to help me in any way shape or form.

              " '              I have been very loyal to Canadian Tire in the past, spend about $500/month avg.  Canadian company, why not support?...well...Long/short of it...I was interested in a Bayside Sun Shelter ($1400 inc. taxes) that was advertised.  I visited the Country Hills store in NW Calgary, AB where a sales associate (stocking items on the shelf) took time to find someone to help me out in the patio section.  I was helped immediately by two very attentive associates (seemed to be a person in management and an extremely friendly associate from the BOH, these two were great!)  One associate called a couple of stores to see if they would reserve one of the units for me to pick up (I had a function for my sister, needed a gazebo for my patio) and the other associate (from the BOH), swear he would have given me the shirt on his back, helped me while the other was locating the unit I wanted to purchase. The lady that was phoning the others stores let me know that I could go to CT Beacon Hill, one unit left.  I hurried over to Beacon Hill, purchased the unit, got it home, spent 2.5 hours setting up...only to be halted by ONE piece of siding (they sent two of the same siding in the box).  My Sisters function was happening in a day!!!  Took the ONE piece that was wrong to Beacon Hill CT, going in to this I knew that there wasn\\'t a lot that the store could do about it, wanted to see if there was a returned like item in the BOH that I could swap the part with?  I met with the GM of Beacon Hill, who promptly set into \"protect mode\" and delivered the perfect cookie cutting GM speech about how the stores are \"owned\" by different people but the company continues to be under one \"umbrella\" and offered me a $50 gift Card, before I even had a chance to talk!  I just wanted some direction from the store that I bought the product from, I didn\\'t need a $50 gift card to fix the issue?  The GM told me about the process of \"hands washed\" once the product has left Canadian Tire (basically, they have no responsibility to the customers after purchase), no big deal, I understood all of that.  I asked if he would reach out to another store, if they had my product, could we make a swap?  the answer was classic, \"the owners wont usually help each others store\"  WHAT????  So the conversation led to the GM seeing my dismay and saying \"well, as the customer what do you want?  How would you resolve the situation?\", on and on.  Funny thing was, every time that I tried to ask a question (yes I was perturbed at this point but not rude), GM would interrupt and say \"what would you do, what do you want as a customer?\", what would I do??? I wouldn\\'t ask the customer what the GM of the store should already know, make the customer happy by listening to their question and don\\'t \"band aid\" the situation with the proverbial \"Gift Card\" solution, that\\'s not what I needed!  Interrupting and continuing to ask the same question is antagonistic, I was frustrated and asked if I could speak to the owner (Chris) whos picture was on a worn/torn sheet of paper by the front door.  I didn\\'t feel that I needed to speak to the GM any longer and thought that I would ask a \"owner\" if there was anyway that he could pull a \"favor\" between \"owners\" and call one of the nearest stores and see if there was \"anything\" they could work out for me? As I approached Chris, his body language told me that he was already in \"protect\" mode, he didn\\'t look me in the eye as he approached, didn\\'t offer any formal handshake or introduction (i announced my name and reached out my hand, I was not in \"fight\" mode, just looking for answers).  When we started to talk, he took a deep sigh as I tried to explain the predicament that I was in, I shared with him that his GM wanted to protect the interest of the store and was unable to help me out.  I told Chris that I felt that the way that the GM was speaking, was antagonistic....WOAH!  Look out, Chris took a deep breath, head back looking to the sky and ROLLED HIS EYES AT ME!!!  \"(GM), is never antagonistic, he is a role model, he is...\", I stopped him and said that the conversation is done, I knew where the GM was talking from, his leader.  He had been taught that a customer isn\\'t right and didn\\'t need to be listened to.  I wasn\\'t given a chance to even explain what I was looking for, the situation that I was in...nope, I was wrong for judging his GM.  I asked why he rolled his eyes at me and didn\\'t let me explain my story, he started with the cookie cutter answer, I tried to explain that I was leaving as a very unhappy customer and would not return to his store EVER, he looked at me, shrugged his shoulder and said, \"OK\".  As I was leaving, I noticed that the GM had positioned himself conveniently behind the Customer Service counter and listening to the conversation between Chris and I, he stopped me to confirm my phone number and said something about ordering another unit that would take 2 weeks to arrive in the store and then we could do the swap of the part.  Sisters function was happening in a few hours, if someone had listened, Chris/GM, they would have understood the panic that I was in, but it was full on \"protect\" mode.Frustrated, I drove to Country Hill Canadian Tire.  I asked for the MOD and was told that Kevin was outside bringing carts in to the store for the busy weekend, WHAT!  A manager doing carts, Hat off Kevin!  Kevin took a small amount of time to call Canadian Tire Deerfoot Mall location and within a matter of a couple of minutes, had a replacement piece from Deerfoot Mall available.  In the meantime, Kevin arranged 3 sales associates task list (they came to him, while on the phone to Deerfoot Mall CT, and he gave them clear direction of what they needed to do during their shift, he also SOLD a patio set to a very nice couple, WHILE ON THE PHONE HELPING ME!  Kudos to Kevin, if you have a recognition program for outstanding customer service, he is the MAN!  I left for Deerfoot Mall CT, was greeted by a very friendly Customer Service lady and the GM of the store (Linda?? I am sorry, I had her name...), who at the time was on the floor facing and conditioning the front of the store (Mind blown, she was Awesome).  They listened to the issue, Customer Service lady called someone and a few seconds later I was met by a very friendly manager/supervisor (lost her name as well) who said \"give me a moment, WE will fix this\".  Again, mind blown, without batting an eyelash, \"WE will fix this!\", what a testament to the TEAMWORK and EMPOWERMENT that the Deerfoot Mall CT leaders demonstrate to their associates.  This lady was gone about two minutes, came back with the piece that I needed and offered me a \"is there anything else that we can do for you today?\"!!!!!  Wow, just Wow.So ALL who are reading this understand, I do not look for deals, specials, GC\\'s when I shop, I am the type that when I see something I buy it, I am very patient with the process (been there, done that) a big box store needs to follow, sometimes it is as simple as listening and thinking outside the box.  Kevin and his team at Country Hills CT-Great Service (all of them), the Team at Derrfoot Mall CT-Over the top WOW!My sisters function in backyard was perfect, you made her and my nephews very happy!  Too many thank yous go out to Country Hills and Deerfoot Mall!I wont EVER shop at Chris Pustowka\\' Beacon Hill store, Ever Again!',\n",

When he finally appeared, I explained the situation, he told me the same thing. So I responded, \"Okay, get a new lamp, put it together here at the store, plug it in and see if it works, if it does then I will do the exchange.  Low and behold, he put it together plugged it in and it would only light 2 levels.

I tried to direct him exactly where to go to find it, and he tells me to “settle down.” What? That was totally uncalled for. I never raised my voice, or acted exasperated whatsoever. He finds the page, then immediately – before specifying the grade of oil, claims “It SAYS FROM $24.95!”. I told him he needs to select the grade first, where he finally sees the item I want, at the price of $24.95.  Another wander to the shelf, and another claim “We don’t have it.” (the other similar items being a different SKU) Despite inventory clearly showing 3 on-hand.Another associate walking by overheard and showed me a similar product, (which the first one was blissfully unaware of) but i wasn\\'t the one I wanted.I thanked him both anyway, and proceeded to the cash with my other items. Got a cashier with a surly disposition who avoided all eye contact.

He called and learned he was in the wrong city; despite our address being correct on our file, they gave him the wrong address. He never did show up again. No one called us.

I never received any confirmation of that time. They claimed that the actual time was set by the contractor but I was not once contacted by the contractor directly.

I was given an assessment and quote of around $700 (with tax) by another garage who was at the time too busy to take me right away.  I left my car at Canadian Tie. The manager there said they would call me after an inspection.  I had not heard back from them for a few hours so I called for a follow-up.  They had taken upon themselves to do some major repairs on my car including installing new shock absorbers in the front and other unverifiable work in the back-end. They were charging me upwards of $3000 to fix my car (work they already started).  I issued a stop work and in the end got my car back but not before having to pay $2000 for work I had not requested, authorized (not signed for) and for some work that was essentially unverifiable. I know I had rights and could have fought this but I just wanted to get out of there and the way I see it, it cost me an extra $1200 to learn that I should NEVER go back there.  The Manager's name is Lee and he is a total con artist (big talker).  AVOID this Canadian Tire store on Innes in Orleans, especially if you have an older car like me.  They are the worst I've seen in a long time.I should have known.  It was just after the first major snow storm of the season, -15 degrees, and every garage in the area had a 3 day back log, except Canadian Tire.  Now I know why. They SUCK!\",\n",

However, from reading the other comments lack of customer service seems to be a reoccurring theme throughout all Canadian Tire Stores.

              " '              I am a female CT customer for about 20 years and Saturday Nov. 11th, 2018 I had the most terrible experience. Customer Service does not exist at the Pickering location, especially with women. I had to put 1 start to be able to post this. You deserve NONE!! I bought 4 new tires and at 10:30 am went to make sure the already paid tires were in the store, I came back at 2:00 pm to drop the car and the keys. I asked them to make a copy of the receipt for the tires. They indicated there was no need. At about 4:15 (Over 2 hours after the scheduled appointment) I got a call asking me for the tires!! I came back to pick up the car at about 5:45 pm (As told by CT. This was 4 hrs after dropping the car). We were asked (My daughter and I) to take the car to the parking lot. They have problems taking it out. The supposedly “ready car” has no air caps (all 4 missing), the all season tires were missing (all 4) as well. We returned for the missing items and they could not find them. The CT report indicated that the all season tires were still good. As they cannot locate the tires, they assumed that some bad ones were ours. They were in a rush to close and go. The employee that seemed on charge just said \"bag them and let\\'s go\" putting his jacket on. When my daughter and I were in the parking lot we noticed a missing nut and a loose nut on one of the wheels. This was mentioned to one of the CT employees we saw outside in the parking lot. He just say \"I am sorry\" and continue his way home. I went to Walmart to look for wheel nuts and called CAA for assistance. CAA tightened the nuts and checked the air pressure. CAA also recommended taking the car for a check within 100 km as they tighten the nuts by hand (No pressurized tool). The CT employees just didn\\'t care about our safety on the road. How can you disregard a customer and her safety? How can you perform half of the job, release the car and just go home. It is a liability issue and a complete disregard for life and people.',\n",
              " '              Absolutely brutal service, I had ran out of gas and got towed to Canadian Tire on Cambie Street in Vancouver.  They had called back and basically said my fuel sensor relay had become defective and that to replace it I would have to buy the whole module and said it would be cheaper just to monitor my mileage and fuel consumption. I brought gas in to the shop, paid them went to start my car only to find out it didn’t start. I went back in to tell the technicians and they then told me I needed a fuel pump. I had paid them for nothing and I was down a ride for the day. I had a buddy who used to work there and he told me had a discussion with the technicians and they said the shop foreman had rolled my vehicle into a wall and possibly damaged the headlight.  I had raised this to his concern ( he never raised it with me ) and he told me he would fix it, fast forward a week later and my headlight cover had blown off when I was driving. I drove back in and showed him this and he tried to lie and say it was the other headlight he damaged. Absolutely brutal, I had tried to convince them to do the right thing and they just denied, denied, denied. Through all of this I still had to pay 828 dollars for the service they did. I will never ever take a vehicle there again.',\n",
              " '              I found the item “Gracious Living 8-Drawer White Tower” Product #142-2057-6, listed on CanadianTire.ca on sale for 1/2 of its Regular Price: $59.99 – Sale Price is $29.99. On September 3, 2018, it showed that they have 7 in stock. That same day, knowing that they have it, I went to their store located at: 250 Silver Linden Drive Richmond Hill, ON L4B 4W7 905-731-3100 I went to aisle # 52 as mentioned on their site, and couldn’t find the items. I went to customer service and spoke to Taz, she confirmed that her system also shows they have 7 in stock. When I informed her that there is none, she paged for a sales associate to meet me in aisle# 52, who told me, “Yeah sorry, I know the system is showing we have 7, the manager is aware of this issue, he’s been looking for them and can’t find them”. I went back to Taz again, I told her what the sales associate said. I requested a rain check, but, she refused to give me one and said this is because the store shows that this item is in stock that’s why she can’t give me a rain check. I said, “Yes it shows you have stock on both your website listing and your local store system, however, you don’t have the physical item available!, therefore you should give me a rain check, I lost time, cost of gas and milage”. She said she can’t give any rain checks. I told her that I don’t agree with her decision and this is deceptive/false advertising, I came from afar all the way to the store only to find out they have none in stock. I asked for a store manager, Yonie came, and told him exactly the same thing, he said he can’t give me a rain check. They did not even offer to call other stores for me, to check which store has this in stock. I believe this is one of Canadian Tire’s way to bring customers to their store - False Deceptive Advertising. So, when customers come for something, they buy other things at the same time. I advised Taz and Yonie that I will post this story public and will also contact the head office, they said that’s fine and it’s my right to do that. CANADIAN TIRE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!
